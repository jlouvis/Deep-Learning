# Deep-Learning

Synopsis 

Project Title: Automating the Segmentation of X-ray Images with Deep Neural Networks 

Team Member: Shuli Sun S232245, Søren Blatt Bendtsen s164521, Pantelis Apostolidis s230697, Ioannis Louvis s222556 

 

Motivation & Background: It is a time-consuming and error-prone process to segment the result images from the X-ray physics experiments. So, we want to build a deep-learning model to do it. 

 

Milestones: 

Week 1: 

Read through references (Image segmentation, UNet, reports by supervisor) 

Read in the data to Python / Pytorch 

Visualize a few images 

See if any type of data preparation / cleaning is needed 

 

Week 2: 

Have access to GPU (using the HPC guide uploaded by the TA’s) 

Start to build a simple model to train the data (Study for Networks like VGGNET, UNet) 

Encoder, Decoder 

 

Week 3 – 4: 

Finetune model and hyperparameters 

Try different techniques 

Neural Network 

 

Week 5: 

Work on Poster Session 

Write report 

 

Week 6 – 7: 

Finetune model  

Finish report
